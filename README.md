# Approxamania
### Details
This is a education application that works around polynomials.
It plots the user specified function along side others,
and has the user guess which one is the specified one.

### Installation
The user will need Qt Software to run the project. Furthermore, 
it GUI mainly comes out for Apple Products, where as Window's
Machines may render the text incorrectly.


### Instructions
When running the game, choose a degree from the spin-box menu,
and then choose the difficulty. The difficulty will decide how
many functions alongside the specified one will be plotted. When
playing, click on the specified graph and click 'Choose Graph.' 
If the selection is incorrect, you will lose a life. If it is correct,
you will progress to the next difficulty. In the end, information
about the specified polynomial will be displayed to have the user
learn about the patterns observed and any other extra information.
