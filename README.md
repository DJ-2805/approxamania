### Details
 This is a education application that works around polynomials.
 It plots the user specified function along side others,
 and has the user guess which one is the specified one.

### Instructions
 When running the game, choose a degree from the spin-box menu,
 and then choose the difficulty. The difficulty will decide how
 many functions alongside the specified one will be plotted. When
 playing, click on the specified graph and click 'Choose Graph.' 
 If the selection is incorrect, you will lose a life. If it is correct,
 you will progress to the next difficulty. In the end, information
 about the specified polynomial will be displayed to have the user
 learn about the patterns observed and any other extra information.
